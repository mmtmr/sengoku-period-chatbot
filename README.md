# Sengoku Period Chatbot and Expert System (Reno)
An expert system is a computer application to solve problems in a specific domain. Even though its first introduction to the world can be dated back to the 1970s, an expert system is still rarely used in the education sector. To wipe off such an under the circumstance. This project is aimed to develop an expert system on the history topic “Sengoku Period” through Dialogflow using a chatbot as a medium. To achieve this, the project team had researched the topic “Sengoku Period” and drew a semantic network in designing the expert system. Also, each of us investigated the expert system and the chatbot through an academic paper to adopt these expertises. After that, the project team implemented the knowledge acquired into the chatbot. Reno, a history educational chatbot, is developed to serve as an information repository or virtual consultant in this project. It provides knowledge with the user on the “Sengoku Period” in three different areas: battle, historical figure, and period. Every knowledge in the system is interconnected. Each can be visited without calling the main menu in less than twenty steps. Reno can also answer questions asked by the users. In the future, the developers can review the user’s questions and match them to the chatbot’s response in order for the chatbot to be more intelligent. Besides that, Reno can make small talk to keep users engaged in the conversation. Reno can be implemented on other platforms to have broader target users instead of only students in the classroom. Reno had received high ratings on ease of use, information contents, interface design, appropriateness among a wide range of ages, and chatbot’s movement in the user acceptance testing in these questionnaires. Through using Reno, users are expected to gain knowledge on the topic “Sengoku Period” and have their questions on the topic answered by Reno.
